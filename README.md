# browser-homepage
It's a custom homepage when I open my browsers.

I used HTML and CSS. No JavaScript needed.

You can add this page easily to your browser.

For example, with Firefox:
- clone this repo
- open your file manager and open `index.html` to Firefox
- copy the url to your clipboard
- open Firefox and go to `settings`
- open `Home` tab
- on `Homepage and new windows`, select `Custom URLs...`
- paste the url
- close and re-open Firefox to see changes
- Tadaaa !
